List products from WordPress on eBay. The easy way.

== Description ==

WP-Lister connects your WooCommerce, WP e-Commerce, Shopp or MarketPress site with your eBay Store. You can select multiple products right from your products page, select a profile to apply a set of predefined options and list them all on eBay with just a few clicks.

We worked hard to make WP-Lister easy to use but flexible. The workflow of listing items requires not a single click more than neccessary. Due to its tight integration in WordPress, your client will not have to learn anything new as he will feel right at home.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does WP-Lister work with all eBay sites? =

Yes, WP-Lister works with all eBay sites.

= What are the requirements to run WP-Lister? =

WP-Lister requires a recent version of WordPress (3.3+) with WooCommerce, WP e-Commerce, MarketPress or Shopp installed. Your server should run on Linux and have PHP 5.2 or better with cURL support.

= I use products variations on my site but eBay doesn’t allow variations in the selected category. How can I find out in which categories variations are allowed? =

To learn more about variations and allowed categories you should visit this page: http://pages.ebay.com/help/sell/listing-variations.html. There you will find a link to eBay’s look up table for categories allowing variations. If you can only list to categories where no variations are allowed, consider purchasing WP-Lister Pro which can split variations into single listings.

WP-Lister is specifically designed to let you manage your products in WordPress - and list them from there on eBay. If you would like to use WP-Lister but you need to import all your items from eBay to WooCommerce first, you might want to use this plugin which we developed to get you started: http://www.wplab.com/plugins/import-from-ebay-to-woocommerce/
