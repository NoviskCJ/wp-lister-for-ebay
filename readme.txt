List products from WordPress on eBay.

== Description ==

WP-Lister connects your WooCommerce, WP e-Commerce, Shopp or MarketPress site with your eBay Store. You can select multiple products right from your products page, select a profile to apply a set of predefined options and list them all on eBay with just a few clicks.

We worked hard to make WP-Lister easy to use but flexible. The workflow of listing items requires not a single click more than neccessary. Due to its tight integration in WordPress, your client will actually not have to learn anything new as he will feel right at home.
